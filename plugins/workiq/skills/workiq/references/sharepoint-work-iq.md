# SharePoint

Use this reference for SharePoint site, group-backed team site, basic
document-library listing, document discovery, and raw file-content tasks.
When the user asks about custom library columns or wants files filtered,
counted, grouped, sorted, or compared by metadata, defer to
`sharepoint-library-metadata.md` and use list-item `fields`. Prefer the bounded
routes below over broad discovery, repeated `search_paths`, or `ask`.

These structured routes serve exact discovery and operations, not a semantic
summary default. Ordinary caller-owned context follows [retrieval policy](retrieve-work-iq.md)
with explicit Grounding; [ask](ask-work-iq.md) requires intentional delegation.
The endpoint examples are inherited contracts, not newly verified live responses.
Use live schemas for unfamiliar operations, and apply [recovery](troubleshooting.md):
explicit access/authentication/policy denial stops without alternate paths or tools.

## First accessible SharePoint site

Use `search=`, not `$search=`, for SharePoint site discovery. The path catalog may advertise OData `$search`, but SharePoint site enumeration works with the non-OData `search` query parameter.

```json
{ "entityUrls": ["/sites?search=*&$select=id,displayName,name,webUrl&$top=1"] }
```

Treat the first returned site as the first accessible site, then fetch the requested resource:

```json
{ "entityUrls": ["/sites/{siteId}/drive"] }
```

```json
{ "entityUrls": ["/sites/{siteId}/lists"] }
```

Do not use `/sites?$search=*`, guessed single-letter searches, an empty search, or `ask`. Do not treat an unfiltered `/sites` response with an empty `value` array as proof that no sites exist.

## Named group-backed team sites

For a named Microsoft 365 group-backed SharePoint team site, resolve the backing group by exact display name instead of relying only on site search. This is especially useful when the display name contains punctuation or characters that OData `$search` rejects, such as underscores.

Escape single quotes in the site name per OData by doubling them, then URL-encode the value before inserting it into the filter.

```json
{ "entityUrls": ["/groups?$filter=displayName%20eq%20'{odataEscapedAndUrlEncodedSiteName}'&$select=id,displayName&$top=1"] }
```

Then resolve the Documents library and its root in one fetch:

```json
{ "entityUrls": ["/groups/{groupId}/drive?$expand=root"] }
```

Then list root children with the resolved root id:

```json
{ "entityUrls": ["/drives/{driveId}/items/{rootId}/children"] }
```

Choose the supported group-drive/root-item route above from the outset. If any
drive root alias or item path is explicitly denied, stop that workflow and report
the actual diagnostic; do not switch addressing modes to bypass the denial.
An error is not evidence that the root folder is empty.

## Search SharePoint documents across sites

Use the read-only Microsoft Search action for bounded structured cross-site
document discovery when the user wants file candidates or a download without a
site/item ID. For semantic evidence and summaries, use the retrieval policy above.

```json
{
  "actionUrl": "/search/query",
  "jsonBody": {
    "requests": [
      {
        "entityTypes": ["driveItem"],
        "query": {"queryString": "IsDocument:True"},
        "from": 0,
        "size": 25,
        "fields": [
          "id",
          "name",
          "webUrl",
          "parentReference",
          "sharepointIds",
          "file",
          "folder",
          "listItem",
          "lastModifiedDateTime"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Filter the returned hits before answering or downloading:

- Prefer team-site URLs under `sharepoint.com/sites/` or `sharepoint.com/teams/` when the user asks for SharePoint team-site content.
- Select driveItems that are files. Prefer typical document extensions such as `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, and `.txt`.
- Do not select folders.
- Do not select SharePoint site pages such as home pages, SitePages entries, or other `.aspx` pages unless the user explicitly asks for a site page.

When the final answer needs the site display name and search did not return it directly, derive the unique site slug from each SharePoint `webUrl` and make one batched fetch with `/sites?search={siteSlug}&$select=id,displayName,name,webUrl&$top=5` for those slugs.

Use a slug only as a lookup term, not as an authoritative site identity. Match
returned site URLs before attaching a display name; qualify ambiguous or missing
matches. Inspect each nested status and preserve successful entries. A bounded
search is not proof of complete library coverage.

## Download raw SharePoint file content

After selecting a SharePoint file driveItem, download raw bytes with `fetch_blob` using the drive-scoped content path:

```json
{ "path": "/drives/{driveId}/items/{itemId}/content" }
```

Do not use `/me/drive` for SharePoint requests. Do not call `fetch` for `/content`; `fetch` only returns JSON metadata. If `fetch_blob` reports that the payload exceeds the 4 MB limit, return the item's `webUrl` so the user can download it directly.

Retain source drive and item IDs from authoritative structured fields; do not
infer them from a search citation or site slug. Shared copy/move/delete and
upload-session mechanics belong in [Files](files-work-iq.md).
