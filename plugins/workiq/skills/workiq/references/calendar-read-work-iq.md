## Known endpoint recipes

Call counts below describe an unambiguous, authorized happy path, not a hard limit.
Identity, required confirmation, supported paging and requested completeness take
precedence. Endpoint query restrictions and payload shapes remain binding.

| Request | Example | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finding the most recent meeting with a person and explaining its agenda | "Which candidate event was my latest meeting with Alex, and what was it about?" | Use structured `fetch`, not `ask`. Fetch bounded candidates or a calendar window with `subject,start,end,body,bodyPreview,attendees,organizer`; retain actual attendee matches, sort by start descending, and answer from the selected event body. |
| Comparing people across two exact calendar events | "Who appears in both of these two event URLs?" | Use one batched `fetch` for both exact `/me/events/{id}?$select=subject,organizer,attendees` URLs. Build each people set from organizer plus attendees, normalize by lowercase email, compute the intersection locally, and report non-overlaps. Do not use `ask`. |
